        <p class="top-paragraph">While no two people are the same, there is a cross-section of features and attributes that many customers look for in their next new vehicle. Customers tend to lean toward a few key criteria:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Fuel efficiency</li>
          <li>Safety</li>
          <li>Performance and handling</li>
          <li>Exterior design</li>
          <li>Reliability</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="top-paragraph">This is just the beginning. The more you interact with customers, the more criteria you’ll begin to notice. Knowing which vehicle is the best choice for customers’ individual needs can rev up a conversation and drive their confidence in you.</p>
