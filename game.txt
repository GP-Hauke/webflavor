ARCHITECTURE:
  - Create production distribution directory that also includes a .zip SCORM package.
  -	Re-organize folder structure to separate core course functionality from reusable components and refactor code accordingly.
  -	Make assessment more modular for different types of assessments. Either separate from game or make game a type of assessment.
  -	Add knowledge check functionality (scoring, tracking on LMS).
  -	Add Create.JS and build prototype of a game
  -	Build a UI to generate scaffold core course files pre-populated with the critical data that needs to go into the SCORM sco01.xml and imsmanifest.xml files and the settings.xml file.
